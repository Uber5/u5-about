# How

Check [the sample](./sample).

Roughly:

* Include the script (TODO: with what key?) from cdn.rawgit.com, see
  [index.html](./sample/index.html).
* Use the `About` and the `LoggedErrors` components somewhere in the app, see
  [app.js](./sample/app.js) for an example.

# How Ready?

Not ready, in development. Don't use.
